# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

Disclaimer: This project was created as a result of following the video tutorial "Build NETFLIX With React JS - Tailwind CSS - FIREBASE - Front-End Web Developer Project" (https://youtu.be/ATz8wg6sg30?si=lORc09lM8vhlJUcx) by Code Commerce
